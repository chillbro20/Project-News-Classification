            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p >You must have seen the news divided into categories when you go to a news website. Some of the popular
                categories that youâ€™ll see on almost any news website are tech, entertainment, and sports. If you want
                to know how to classify news categories using machine learning, this article is for you. In this
                article, we will walk you through the task of news classification with machine learning using Python.
                Every news website classifies the news article before publishing it so that every time visitors visit
                their website can easily click on the type of news that interests them. For example, If someone like to
                read the latest technology updates, so every time he visit a news website, He click on the technology
                section. But someone may or may not like to read about technology, he may be interested in politics,
                business, entertainment, or maybe sports.
                Currently, the news articles are classified by hand by the content managers of news websites. But to
                save time, they can also implement a machine learning model on their websites that read the news
                headline or the content of the news and classifies the category of the news. In the section below, We
                will take you through how you can train a machine learning model for the task of news classification
                using the Python programming language.
